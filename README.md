# Bulk Image Upload with Filestack Demo

## Bulk Image Upload with Filestack Example

This project demonstrates a web-based image bulk upload functionality using the Filestack API. It allows users to upload multiple images simultaneously, display resized versions of uploaded images in a grid layout, and provides links to view the original images.

- **Responsive Grid Display:** Uploaded images are displayed in a neat, responsive grid.
- **Filestack Transformations:** Images are resized and cropped to a uniform 200x200 pixels using Filestack's transformation features.
- **Dynamic File Info:** Each uploaded image includes its name and a link to view the full-size image.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   `git clone <repository-url>`
   
   `cd <repository-folder>`

3. **Edit API Key:**

- Open index.html and replace YOUR_API_KEY with your Filestack API key.

3. **Open in Browser:**

- Double-click the `index.html` file or serve it via a local web server. (Using a local server is recommended, as some features may not function correctly when opened directly in the file explorer.)

### Filestack Transformations Used

- **Resize:**
  - Ensures images are uniformly cropped to 200x200 pixels.

    `https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/resize=width:200,height:200,fit:crop/<file_handle>`

### Notes

- Ensure you have a valid Filestack API key.
- Use modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox) for the best experience.
